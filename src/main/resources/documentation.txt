### font

Change font

Use this tag to control the font. You can choose from most of the fonts that
you have installed, but note there may be some that, for various reasons, cannot
be used in PDF documents. In addition, you can of course find many fonts online.

For some fonts there is a choice of "encoding" which is a choice of which
set of characters to use related to the language of the text.

The fonts that you use are embedded in the PDF document to ensures that the
document will be shown in exactly the same fonts on any other computer. This
also means that the document file is larger than it would otherwise have been.

If a font cannot be embedded, e.g. due to license restrictions, you can use the
keyword 'local' for the 'font' tag. TextCompose will then not attempt to embed
the font, for example<br>

&#160;&#160;&lt;font "A Yummy Apology" local&gt;<br>

This allows you to try the font before paying the license.


### size

Change font size

Use this tag to control font size. You can specify the size in absolute terms
as the size in points or relative to the current font size, such as +2, -2 or
+30%.


### face

Change font face

Use this tag to control font face such as italic or bold.


### color

Change colors

Use this tag to control color. You can control the color of the
text, the line when underlining text, highlighting, page color, frame around images,
border on tables, cell background color, and drawing color.
The color can be specified in either RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness).
You can specify RGB as either three decimal numbers in the range 0-255 or in hexadecimal notation.

Examples: &lt;color RGB 221 40 33&gt; or &lt;color RGB #DD2821&gt;
Hue, saturation and lightness are specified as three decimal numbers,
hue in the range 0-360 and the other two in the range 0-100.


### underline

Underline text

Use this tag to select underlining of text. 

You can also control the color of the line, the thickness of the line and the height
of the line in relation to the baseline. Both the thickness and height can be specified
in points or as a percentage of font size.


### highlight

Highlight text

Use this tag to start highlighting the text. You can also control the size of the
highlighting either as one number, or four numbers to specify it in each of the four directions.

Note that you can control the color of the highlighting with the 'color' tag.


### letter-spacing

Change letter-spacing

Letter-spacing is the space between the characters. The tag allows you to change this spacing.

Letter-spacing is specified either in absolute terms as number of points or as a percentage of
the font size. So for example, 10% means adding 10% of font size to the regular letter-spacing
and -1 means subtracting 1 point from the regular letter-spacing.


### scale-letter

Stretch or squeeze letters horizontally

Letter scaling is horizontal scaling of the characters, so stretching them out or squeezing
them together without changing their height.

Letter scaling is specified as a percentage where 100 is the regular font without scaling.
Since it is always specified as a percentage, the '%' sign is left out.


### height

Change line height

So changes the amount of space between the lines, the "leading".

Line height can be specified in points or as a percentage of font size.


### paragraph-space

Change paragraph space

Use this to change the vertical space before (above) and after (below) paragraphs.
This can be specified in points or as a percentage of font size.

One way to lay out paragraphs is to use space between paragraphs. Another common
way is to have no additional space, but instead indent the first line of each
paragraph. This is accomplished with the tag 'paragraph-indent'


### paragraph-indent

Change paragraph indentation

Change the setting for indentation of (first line of) paragraphs.

This is typically used instead of additional vertical space between paragraphs.

The tag allows you to set up the indentation in points or as a percentage of font size.
Moreover, you can specify if the indentation should be "delayed" meaning that the
first paragraph after enabling the paragraph indentation is not indented - so the
indentation is delayed until the second (and subsequent) paragraphs.


### new

Break to new line, paragraph, column or page

In general, a line break in the source file does not give rise to a line break in the
PDF document. However, note that the 'whitespace' tag allows you to change this behavior.

In general, an empty line in the source file gives rise to a new paragraph.
However, note that the 'whitespace' tag can change this behavior.

The number of columns on a page is set up using the 'columns' tag.

You can specify a number of points as a "limit" for when to actually break to a new
column or page. If the tag is encountered when the text is at a distance of the bottom
margin which is within this limit then a new column/page is started. This can be used when
you define a new tag for section headers for example, if you do not wish such headers
to appear too close the bottom margin.


### align

Control alignment of text, images, cells

You have the choice between left and right alignment, centered and full justification
of text and table cell content.


### indent

Control text indentation

You can specify left and right indentation, both in points.


### rise

Raise or lower text

Change vertical position of text relative to the baseline.


### position

Control text position

Place the latest chunk of text at a give position and angle.

This can be used for inserting page number and page headers.


### document

Set document properties

Specify any of the PDF document properties: title, author, subject and keywords.

Keywords are separated by comma, e.g. "political reform, social justice".

Note that this is "meta data" which can be seen in PDF viewers.


### view

Set PDF viewer preferences

Allows you to control the viewing preferences when the document is opened in a
PDF viewer. Note that not all PDF viewer applications respect these preferences.
The viewer that comes with Mac OS X, for instance, ignores the preferences whereas
Adobe Reader handles them as you would expect.

The first parameter allow you to choose between page or column view with one or
two pages or columns side by side.

The second parameter allows you to select outline view, page thumbnails or full screen.


### encrypt

Encrypt the document

You can specify "user password" and "owner password".

A user entering the user password can read the document. You can specify which other
possibilities the user should be granted, such as allowing the user to copy from
the document.

A user entering the owner password has full access to the document.

Note that the encryption must be specified first thing, before the content.


### page-size

Change page size

You can either choose a standard page size such as A4, Letter, Ledger or specify
the height and width in points.


### orientation

Change page orientation

The choice between landscape and portrait.


### columns

Lay out text in columns

You specify the number of columns per page and the size of the "gutter",
the space between the columns.


### margins

Change size of margins


### pagecolor

Change page color

The color of a page is determined by the latest page color assigned at the moment that page
is started. This means that the page color for the first page should be specified before
adding content to the page. If you wish to change page color from one page to the next
then do so before the page break. 


### image

Insert image

Use this tag to insert images into the document.

If you insert an image more than once, consider using the keyword 'cache'. This will reduce the
size of the document file because the image only will be embedded once into the document.

You can control the opacity of the image as a percentage.

You can specify the position of the image relative to any of the corners or center of the page or margin. 
Note that when you specify position, the flow of text is not affected by the insertion of the image.
If you wish text to be visible over the image, use the keyword 'under' for the image.


### scale-image

Scale inserted image

Use this to scale up/down the images that you insert into the document. Horizontal and vertical
scaling are specified independently. The scaling can be specified either as absolute size in points
or relative to the original size of the image, relative to page size, relative to size within
margins, or relative to the column.


### fit-image

Scale-to-fit inserted image

Use this to scale up/down the images that you insert into the document by specifying the
rectangle that the image should be scaled to fit into. The scaling can be specified either as
absolute size in points or relative to the page size, relative to size within margins, or
relative to the column. As opposed to the 'scale-image' tag, this tag preserves the aspect ratio.


### frame

Frame images

Use this to get frames on the images that you insert. The tag can either be given 'on' or 'off'
to enable/disable frames, or a number for the frame width.

Note that you can control frame color with the 'color' tag.


### rotate-image

Rotate images

Use this tag to rotate the images that you insert into the document by specifying the
degrees of rotation (so a number between 0 and 360 with 90 being a right angle counter-clockwise).


### blend

Specify how overlapping images should blend

Note that the current preview window does NOT render this correctly. So to see
the actual result, please open the document in your PDF viewer.


### format-list

Specify format of list

Use this tag to control the the formatting and appearance of lists.
The two first parameters are indentations: indentation of the list and additional
indentation of the content of the list.

The third parameter is the "number" or "bullet" of the list
such as (1), 1., [1] &#167;1,... or &#149;. The specification uses $1 for the number,
so to get (1), (2), (3),... you would write ($1).

You could also get (i), (ii), (iii), (iv),... by writing "&lt;Roman L $1&gt;" in the
third parameter. For a bullet list, you could write "&lt;char 8226&gt;", which works
if you use a font that contains this standard bullet.


### list

Insert list

Use this tag to start a list and the tag 'item' for each item in the list.

The formatting of the list items can be controlled with the tag 'format-list'.

Note that you can insert lists inside list.


### item

Insert item in list.


### /list

End list.


### table

Insert table.


### /table

End table.


### cell

Insert cell into table


### cell-color

Control table cell color


### cell-padding

Control table cell padding


### border-width

Control table border width


### border-color

Control table border color


### line-width


### line-color


### line-cap


### line-dash


### move-to


### line-to


### draw


### opacity


### insert

Insert other source file

It may be convenient to break up a large document into sections that you work with in
individual source files (files with extension 'wr'), or to collection multiple sources
into one document.

The tag takes one parameter which is the name of the file that you wish to insert.

The file chooser insert the file name including the full path, but it actually
also works with just the file name provided that the two source files are in the
same directory/folder.


### char

Insert character

Insert character in the current font. The parameter is the character position
as a hexadecimal number. Note that the rendering of the character, i.e. the
"graphic symbol" (glyph) that you will see in the PDF document will depend
not only on the parameter but also the current font and font encoding (code
page) at that position in the document. See also the 'glyph' tag.


### glyph

Insert a glyph

Insert a glyph. This is similar to the 'char' tag but here you also specify
font apart from the character position as a hexadecimal number. The dialog
for this tag allows you to see the available glyphs in the chosen font and
encoding.


### Roman

Format number as Roman number

The first parameter, U or L, allows you to choose between upper and lower case (IV or iv).
The second parameter is that number to present as a Roman number.


### bookmark

Insert a bookmark


### label

Insert a label

A label is a reference point, a destination that you can jump to from elsewhere in the document.
You give it a name and can then insert references (links) to it using that name.
References are inserted using the 'ref' and corresponding end-tag.

Note that bookmarks (inserted with the 'bookmark' tag) are also labels Ð but in addition to
being labels also appear in the "outline" (list of content) pane in PDF viewers.


### ref

Insert reference

Insert a reference (link) to a label or bookmark. The references appears on the content (text)
between the 'ref' tag and its end-tag '/ref'.


### /ref

End reference


### store

Store the current "state"

Here, "state" refers to all settings, such as the current choice of font, font size, text color etc.
The tag stores the state on a "stack" so that you can return it it later using the 'restore' tag.
This can be useful if you which to make some temporary change and then return to whatever the
settings were before that change (without having to know or think about what they were).


### restore

Restore the latest state that was stored

The 'restore' tag restores the state (settings) that were stored with the tag 'state',
and also removes those settings from the stack of states.


### reset

Reset the current state.

Change the "state" (all settings, such as choice of font) to the "base" settings, these are
the "built-in" defaults for font, font size etc. This can be useful when you inject code
that should be independent of the current state, such as insertion of a page number or page
header. The 'reset' tag does not add or remove from the stack of states, but updates the
current state. You will typically first 'store', 'reset', then do what you have to do, and
end with 'restore'.


### var

Declare a new variable

The first parameter is the name of the variable. The second parameter is the type, either Int or Str.
The third, optional, parameter is the keyword 'converge'; it has the effect that you get out the final,
converged value. The content of variables is manipulated with the tags 'set' and 'add' and inserted
into the document with tag 'show'.

If you wish to include page number of the form "x of y" where y is the number of pages, then this would
require two variables of type Int: one for the current page number and one for the "final" page number.
The page number variable you would update with the 'add' tag and the final page number would be set to
the page number. The final page number variable would use the 'converge' keyword.

Another use of 'converge' is when you wish to present a list of content in the beginning of a document.
Here you can have a variable of type Str and marked 'converge'. Note that Str variables can contain
not just plain text, but also tags.

The effect of declaring a variable with 'converge' is that the 'show' tag gives you the "final" value
instead of the current value. However, note that it can take some iterations for a variable to
converge to this "final" value.
 

### set

Assign a value to a variable

Takes one parameter - the name of the variable. The variable is assigned to whatever appears between
this tag and the subsequent end tag, &lt;/set&gt;. 

### /set

End tag for &lt;set&gt;

### add

Add a value to a variable

Takes one parameter - the name of the variable. The variable is incremented by whatever appears between
this tag and the subsequent end tag, &lt;/add&gt; For variables of type Int this means addition and for type
Str this means concatenation.

### /add

End tag for &lt;add&gt;

### show

Show variable in document.

Takes one parameter - the name of the variable. This tag gives you the content of the variable.
This typically means that you show the content of the variable, i.e. insert the content into the document.

Note that if you use 'show' inside a parameter for a tag, then the value is inserted at that moment of
the evaluation. In other words, the 'show' tag is not passed along into the tag. This has some advantages.
For example, you can pass a variable to the 'bookmark' tag with the effect that you see the content of the
variable in (or as part of) the bookmark. However, this feature can lead to situations where you keep
seeing the initial value instead of the updated value. This can be worked around by moving the 'show' tag
into a separate tag definition (in an inclusion).


### include

Include an extension


See the description of extensions.


### extension

Declare name of extension

Extensions are files that extend your list of available tags. An extension file must start with
the 'extension' tag to give the extension a name/title, and before you can use it from other
files (with the 'include' tag) you must add it in the 'Extensions' menu.

To define a tag in an extension, use the 'def' tag and its corresponding end-tag '/def'.

Extensions can contain two other kinds of definitions Ð using 'sub' and 'main'. The difference
between tags defined using 'sub' and 'def' is that 'sub'-tags do not appear in the left-hand menu.
An extension can contain at the most one 'main' tag. This tag has no parameters and is evaluated
first thing when you include the extension.

Note that the 'include' tag can be used in extensions.


### def

Define a tag

This tag is used inside extensions to define new tags. The tag takes one or more parameters:
the name of the new tag optionally followed by the titles of any parameters for the tag.

The values of the parameters can be accessed inside the body of the definition (between 'def'
and '/def') with ^1 for the first parameter, ^2 for the second parameter etc.


### /def

End tag definition


### sub

Define an "internal" tag

The only difference between using 'def' and 'sub' is that tags defined using 'sub' do not
appear in the left-hand menu.


### /sub

End tag definition


### main

Define "main" of an extension

The main block has no parameters and is evaluated when you include the extension.
It can be used for default settings and declaring variables, for example.


### /main

End main definition.


### template

Declare name of template

A template is a file that you have added to the list of templates in the menu 'Templates'.
When you create a new file, you can choose from the list of templates. The only requirement
to a file before you can add it as a template is that you have used the tag 'template' in the
first line to give it a name.


### inject


### replace


### loop

Insert a loop

Loop over some range of numbers or the content of a variable of type 'Map'.


### whitespace

Keep or trim whitespace

Control if leading whitespace and line-breaks should be trimmed (default) or kept.
